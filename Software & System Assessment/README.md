# Software Systems Competency Assessment

## INTRODUCTION
This document assesses my competency in Software Systems, outlining my core strengths, areas for improvement, and how these skills integrate with other domains in the curriculum. This will help guide the development of my portfolio and capstone prototype.

## COMPETENCIES & STRENGTHS
Throughout my coursework, particularly in **CIDM 6303 (Tech Foundation)** and **CIDM 6330 (Software Engineering)**, I developed core software systems competencies including:

- **Python Programming:** Confident in writing scripts and implementing algorithms.
- **Web Development:** Built foundational knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Django for building full-stack web applications.
- **Software Design Principles:** Gained experience with architectural styles, design foundations, and development frameworks.

## WEAKNESSES AND AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
While I am confident in key areas, I have identified the following areas for growth:

- **Advanced Django Use:** I have experience with basic apps but need to improve my understanding of middleware, APIs, and authentication.
- **DevOps Practices:** Limited exposure to CI/CD pipelines, containerization (e.g., Docker), and cloud deployment.
- **Software Testing & Debugging:** I want to enhance my ability to write unit tests and perform automated testing.

## STEPS FOR IMPROVEMENT
- Enroll in online tutorials on **advanced Django** and backend development.
- Work on personal projects integrating **Docker, GitHub Actions, or Azure** for DevOps practice.
- Practice writing **unit tests** with `pytest` and explore test-driven development (TDD).

## INTEGRATION WITH OTHER CURRICULAR AREAS
Software Systems is integrally connected with the other domains:

- **Data Analytics:** Python is used to implement machine learning models and analytics pipelines.
- **Data Management:** Backend systems often rely on relational databases, requiring schema design and SQL.
- **Cybersecurity & Networking:** Web application development requires secure authentication, HTTPS, and protection against vulnerabilities.

## INTEGRATION WITH PRIOR WORK
- Built Python scripts for data cleaning and ML classification tasks.
- Designed ER diagrams and implemented SQL backends for Django apps.
- Developed simple CRUD web applications incorporating HTML, CSS, and Django.

## CONTRIBUTION TO THE CAPSTONE
My capstone project will likely involve building a web-based dashboard or system. My experience with **Python, Django, and web development** forms the backbone for implementing the functional interface of my solution, integrating data and analytics features securely.
