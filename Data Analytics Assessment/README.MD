INTRODUCTION
This document provides an assessment of my competency in Data Analytics, highlighting my strengths, weaknesses, areas for improvement, and how my skills integrate with other areas of my coursework. This assessment will serve as a foundation for my capstone portfolio and prototype project.

COMPETENCIES & STRENGTHS
Through my coursework, I have developed strong skills in the following areas:
- Data Preparation: Proficient in handling and cleaning datasets for analysis.
Data Visualization: Skilled in using tools such as Tableau, RapidMiner, and MS Excel to present data insights.
RapidMiner & R: Confident in utilizing both RapidMiner and R for data mining and predictive analytics.
SQL & Database Management: Competent in designing relational schemas and managing structured data.
Business Intelligence: Experienced in interpreting data to support decision-making processes.

WEAKNESSES AND AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
While I have developed strong skills, there are areas where I need improvement:
•	Data Interpretation: I need to enhance my ability to draw insights and make business recommendations based on analytical results.
•	Advanced Data Mining Techniques: While I have used RapidMiner, I aim to gain deeper knowledge of complex machine learning algorithms.
•	MongoDB & NoSQL Databases: I need more experience with non-relational databases for handling unstructured data.

STEPS FOR IMPROVEMENT
•	Enrol in advanced data analytics courses** to strengthen my interpretation skills.
•	Work on real-world projects** utilizing data mining techniques beyond RapidMiner.
•	Practice using MongoDB for storing and querying unstructured data.

INTEGRATION WITH OTHER CURRICULAR AREAS
Data Analytics is essential across multiple domains, making it a core component of my learning experience. It integrates seamlessly with:
•	Data Management: Data Analytics relies on structured and unstructured data stored in databases, requiring strong SQL and database management skills.
•	Software Systems: Analytical models and machine learning algorithms are implemented using programming languages like Python, which is also used in software development.
•	Networking & Cybersecurity: Security threat detection and anomaly detection in cybersecurity leverage data analytics techniques such as pattern recognition and predictive modelling.

HOW DATA ANALYTICS INTEGRATES WITH MY PRIOR WORK
•	Used SQL queries to extract and analyse structured data from databases.
•	Applied data mining techniques to identify patterns in cybersecurity datasets.
•	Developed a machine learning model in Python to classify security threats.

By combining **Data Analytics, Data Management, Software Systems, and Networking & Cybersecurity**, I can develop robust data-driven solutions that enhance decision-making and security. My capstone project will incorporate these skills, demonstrating their real-world applicability.

CONCLUSION
This assessment provides a roadmap for my capstone project, outlining my strengths, weaknesses, and integration across multiple domains. Moving forward, I will refine my skills in **data interpretation and advanced analytics techniques** while leveraging my proficiency in database management and visualization tools. This will ensure my capstone project is comprehensive and impactful.
